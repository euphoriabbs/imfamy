# The Euphoria Bulletin Board System
The next generation Euphoria built on Iniquity3

# Synopsis
Inside your newly created Iniquity system directory, Start Euphoria using the Iniquity command inside of your recently initialized Iniquity System directory.

    iniquity

# Euphoria Setup 

## Create
Initialize the current directory as an Iniquity System, passing a third argument which informs Iniquity to name your BBS Euphoria.

    iniquity init Euphoria

## Install Recommended Iniquity Packages
Iniquity, by itself, has no package dependencies. However, Iniquity provides a few recommended packages focusing specifically on the core mechanics of any BBS. Such as users, files, and messages. These can serve as a great starting point for more advanced sysops.

    iqpkg install userbase messagebase filebase

## Configuration
Out-of-the-box, your Iniquity BBS should start with no additional configuration. However, to customize your server settings, you can easily modify the Iniquity created euphoria.ini file, and tune it to your taste.

    vim euphoria.ini
